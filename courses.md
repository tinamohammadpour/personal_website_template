                           There is a life-force
                             within your soul,
                             seek that life.
                           There is a gam in the
                            mountain of your body,
                             seek that mine.
                            O traveler,if you are
                              in search of that,
                            don't look outside,
                              look inside yourself
                              and seek that.
